# About the Project

This program allows you to interface with the database for the women's World Cup. You may access and update information about players, teams, and stadiums. You may additionally read but not edit information about matches that have occurred, the world champions of a particular season, team groups, and tournaments.

This program uses a user interface created with tkinter, which is already native to python library. Tkinter is a good tool for building simple grahical user interfaces(GUIs) as it provides easy to create a user interface and is cross-platform. Using the gui is pretty simple and straight forward, allowing the user to perform many operation such as CRUD(Create, Read, Write,and Delete) operations as well as some more advanced SQL queries. 

The project is part of the CS425 course, database organization. The goal with completing the project is to build a simple application that uses a database backend, for each group there was a different topic of interest, for this project specically the topic was the Women's World Cup.
