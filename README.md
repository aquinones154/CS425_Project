# CS425_Project

This program allows you to interface with the database for the women's World Cup. You may access and update information about players, teams, and stadiums. You may additionally read but not edit information about matches that have occurred, the world champions of a particular season, team groups, and tournaments.

This program uses a text interface in the terminal. Menus are provided to guide the user through the program, allowing them to read from a database table, create new data in a table, delete data from a table, update existing data, or quit the program. The program will prompt for every single piece of data necessary for the relevant process, minimizing the effort on the user's part to format and order information correctly.
